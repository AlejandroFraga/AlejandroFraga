## Hi! I'm Alejandro Fraga Cimadevila, a Game Programmer based in Galicia (Spain)

I love video games. Playing or making them. I just graduated with [Honors](http://alejandrofraga.me/resources/docs/Certificate_Video_Game_Development_Alejandro_Fraga_Cimadevila.pdf) from the [Master in Video game Development](http://www.videojuegos-ucm.es/) by the [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english) and I am starting my professional career in the video games industry. [Graduated in Computer Engineering](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/degrees/engineering-and-architecture/computer-engineering-degree), I’ve been working in software companies from Madrid and Santiago de Compostela.

### My Journey

I studied [Computer Engineering](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/degrees/engineering-and-architecture/computer-engineering-degree) in the [University of Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.gal/en). While studying, I made extracurricular practices in [Bahía Software](https://bahiasoftware.es/home), a software consultancy, as a Full-Stack developer. After that, I was offered a job as an Intern developer.

I moved to Madrid to study the [Master in Video game Development](http://www.videojuegos-ucm.es/) whose main goal is to specialize IT Engineers in Professional video games programming. During that time I also worked at [Expleo Group](https://expleogroup.com/), a software consultancy, as a Backend Developer in charge of the maintenance of an application for [Siemens](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/global/en.html).

The Final Master Project consisted in developing of a PC video game as part of a team of 20+ people, divided in 5 specialized departments and using [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)
This great experience allowed me to perform within a multidisciplinary group as well as improve my team working skills. The final product is [Voidout](https://loopgang-studios.itch.io/voidout).
